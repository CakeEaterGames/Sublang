Compiles a Sublang program into Subleq code

sublang.exe -i InputFilePath [-o OutputFilePath] [-p] [-c] [-r [-t]] [h [page]]

-h [page] prints pages of a tutorial on how to write programs in Sublang
-i InputFilePath Read program from this file
-o OutputFilePath Write the result to this file
-c Compile the input file first
-p Print the compiled code to the console
-r Run the program
-t Trace the program step by step

Examples:

  sublang.exe -i input.txt -o output.txt -c -r

Reads a Sublang program from input.txt, compiles it into subleq, writes the result program into output.txt, and runs the compiled program

  sublang.exe -i input.txt -r

Reads a COMPILED program from input.txt and runs it

  sublang.exe -i input.txt -c -p -r
