If your program will have a lot of functions you can use the !include keyword to store their code in different files

file "a.txt":
  function subleq(a,b,c)
  {
    a,b,c
  }

Input:
  !include "a.txt"
  function main()
  {
    subleq(1,2,3)
  }
Output:
  1,2,3

Warning
!include is not as optimised as it can be. Avoid including fines with long lines. (thousands of characters long)
