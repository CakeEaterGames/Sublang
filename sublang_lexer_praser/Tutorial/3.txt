Lables can be used as constants that point to memory cells:
Lables can be used locally and globaly. Labels declared inside a function are prioritised over lables delared outside the function

Input:
  function main()
  {
    start:
      0,1,2,
      3,4,5,    
      a,a,b,
      start, start, start,
    a:
    b:
      123,
  }
Output:
  0 1 2
  3 4 5
  12 12 12
  0 0 0
  123

There is a special lable '?' that is always set to the index of a cell that it is placed in

Input:
  function main()
  {
    ?,?,?
  }
Output:
  0 1 2

Arithmetic operators can be used to change cell values before compilation

Input:
  function main()
  {
    a,
    a+1,
    a-1,
    a+5*2,
    a+(10+1)*2,
    a/2,

    a:1000,
  }
Output:
  6
  7
  5
  16
  28
  3
  1000
