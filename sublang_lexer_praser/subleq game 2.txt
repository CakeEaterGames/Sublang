space exploration game

loop:
	start on a planet
	mine it's resourses
	fight aliens if there are any
	spend ore on upgrades
	lift off
	navigate though space
	find another planet

from the player's perspective autoamte:
	planet cleaning (Kill all aliens, mine all ores, convert to fuel)
	upgrade managment 
	space searching (find another planet)
	Threat analysys (Should I clear this planet or find a safer one (are aliens stealing my resourses faster than I'm mining new ones))
	space searching horisontal (find similar planets)
	space cleaning. Find all planets and clear them
	
goals:
	find the center of the galaxy
	visit every planet
	buy all upgrades
	mine all resourses on all planets
	kill all aliens
		
resources:
	orium   - on every planet in large quantity
	rarium  - on some planets in small quantity
	starium - on some planets in very small quantity

upgrades:
	tank   - ship can store X more fuel
	cargo  - ship can store X more ore
	drill  - drill can mine X more ore
	fuel   - traveling takes less fuel
	thrust - upgrade the maximum thruster speed
	radar  - increase the visibility in space
	gun    - you kill more aliens per action
	

planet actions:
	scan      - tells information about the planet (chance of an attack, amount of ore)
	mine X    - decrease planet's ore by X, increase your ore by X
	fuel      - convert 10 ore into 1 fuel
	upgrade X - converts ore and other resourses into permanent upgrades
	fight     - kill n aliens
	launch    - lift off to space
	stats
	help
	
space actions:
	wsad     - fly in directions
	thrust n - set the thrusters to different speed to fly more cells
	scan     - gives coordinates for the nearest planet
	land     - land on a planet

	help
	
	
How to arganise memory?
	a planets is a struct:
		chunk,x,y,symbol,name(5 chars),ore1,ore2,ore3,aliens 
	space is an array of planets sorted by chunk
	
to draw a view:
	a view is an array n by n that will be printed on to the screen
	clear that array
	for top left corner of it, get the chunk that the corner is located in
	for each planet in that chunk. If the coordinate is inside the screen rect, place it in the array
	increase the point x value by chunk size
	repeat
	if point's pos is outside the rect reset it and increase the y value
	repeat
	if point's pos is outside the rect you are done
	
	
	use binary search to find the planets in array by getting the current chunk of the ship
	


How to make this:
	make a string file converter
	generate a bunch of planets structures in other language
	all of them are loacated in 4 chunks
